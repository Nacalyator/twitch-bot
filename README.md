# twitch-bot
This is my first try to write my own chat bot for my friend-streamer (yo MoroEmber)
Realized:
* Now it can connect to chat;
* Scanning messages in chat for cmd '!wr'.
Plans:
* Cmd '!wr gamename' must return to chat records for this game from speedruns.com;
* Cmd '!wr' must return records for current game.
